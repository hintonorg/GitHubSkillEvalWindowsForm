# GitHubSkillEvalWindowsForm

In github, I created a test organization and four test repositories. The organization is “hintonorg” and the repositories are “HintonTest”, “HintonTest2”, “HintonTest3” and “HintonTest4”. The repositories, initially do not have licenses. The link is https://github.com/hintonorg.
I have created a windows form program in c# and visual studio. The program uses the octokit github API library. I have included the code in the “GitHubSkillEvalWindowsForm” repository in the “hintonorg” organization. You can download the code and compile it in visual studio or you can just download the “GitHubSkillEvalWindowsForm.exe” program with “Octokit.dll” and it will run in windows. The program looks for missing licenses in the repositories under “hintonorg”. If there is not a license then it will create one.
